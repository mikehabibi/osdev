libc
----
Libc contains general functions that aren't necessarily tied to the kernel,
and can also be used (with perhaps different implementations) in userspace.
Most people are familiar with libc calls, functions such as printf, strlen,
etc.

My libc implementation can be compiled in either kernel-space or user-space
mode. The kernel builds libc for itself to use in kernel-space mode. The
user-space version of libc can be built for applications with a separate make
target (check the Makefile for the latest target).

Kernel-space
------------
The kernel-space variant builds the library with the assumption that it will
not be running in user-space. This is an important distinction, because when
it's in kernel-space it ha access to privileged calls and drivers directly,
whereas user-space applications will likely need to make system calls to run
certain things in the kernel. Most of this behavior is still TBD as of this
writing.

There are some functions, such as printk, which are only built for the kernel
variant.
