Bochs installation
-------------------
I compiled this on Debian 7 running kernel 3.2.0. I needed to install the GTK
2.0 dev libraries in order to get the debugger GUI compiling correctly. The
configure script doesn't properly detect the lack of GTK dev libraries
before it starts compiling. Additionally, I needed the readline dev libraries
as well.

Bochs 2.6.7 was downloaded from SourceForge and compiled with the following
options:

./configure \
--enable-x86-64 \
--enable-vmx \
--enable-svm \
--enable-avx \
--enable-long-phy-address \
--enable-e1000 \
--enable-fast-function-calls \
--enable-debugger \
--enable-debugger-gui \
--enable-usb \
--enable-usb-ohci  \

make

make install

Bochs configuration
--------------------

See bochs/bochsrc for configuration details. The default BIOS and VGABIOS
are being utilized. Nothing fancy for the first-run through.

You will need to export $BXSHARE with the directory where your BIOS images
are located. For example, on my system it would be /usr/local/share/bochs.

Bochs doesn't supply a disk image to start with, so you will need to create
one. This can be done using the 'bximage' command. I created a 30M flat disk
named "hda.img". For size reasons, this file isn't added to the git repo.
