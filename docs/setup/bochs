Bochs installation
-------------------

Bochs 2.6.7 was downloaded from SourceForge and compiled with the following
options:

./configure \
--enable-x86-64 \
--enable-vmx \
--enable-svm \
--enable-avx \
--enable-long-phy-address \
--enable-e1000 \
--enable-fast-function-calls \
--enable-debugger \
--enable-debugger-gui \
--enable-usb \
--enable-usb-ohci  \

make

make install

I compiled this on Debian 7 running kernel 3.2.0. I couldn't get the build
working with debugger GUI, it couldn't find the GTK header despite having
installed the GTK dev packages.

Bochs configuration
--------------------

See bochs/bochsrc for configuration details. The default BIOS and VGABIOS
are being utilized. Nothing fancy for the first-run through.

You will need to export $BXSHARE with the directory where your BIOS images
are located. For example, on my system it would be /usr/local/share/bochs.

Bochs doesn't supply a disk image to start with, so you will need to create
one. This can be done using the 'bximage' command. I created a 30M flat disk
named "hda.img". For size reasons, this file isn't added to the git repo.
